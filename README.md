# WebApp
A WebApp that will record your email and height, send the information to the cloud MySQL database, and gives back an average height to you through email.

In Visual Studio Code, created a website application using html, css and Flask to collect user information.  Connected Python to MySQL database in the cloud using Pythonanywhere.com and SQLAlchemy and stored user information in MySQL database after users fill in the forms. Gave feedback that include statistical reports from the database to the users by connecting the app to gmail server using smtplib package and sending an email to them.
